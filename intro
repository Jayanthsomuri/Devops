Waterfall Development Model :- It has distinct goals for each of development. Imagine a waterfall on the cliff of a steep

Steps involved in traditional model:
-> Requirements and Gathering Analysis

->Implement
->Test

-> Maintenance
Limitations:- High amounts of risk and uncertainity, No working software is produced until late during the life cycle the main disadvantage no reverting back
