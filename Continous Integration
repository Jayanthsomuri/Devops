// Continous Integration:- Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests are triggered upon each integration. 
This ensures that the codebase is continuously verified for stability and correctness, enabling early detection of integration errors and reducing the risk of defects.
